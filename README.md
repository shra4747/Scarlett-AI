# Scarlett AI FRC Video Scouter

![Scarlett Gif](scarlett.gif)

Scarlett is an intelligent system designed to track and analyze the robots in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) matches. Leveraging the power of YOLO object tracking models, Scarlett processes video footage to detect and track the positions of six robots on the field. The system goes beyond simple object detection by identifying the robots' teams through analyzing their unique team numbers using advanced OCR techniques combined with the Levenshtein distance algorithm for accurate matching. By automating scouting, Scarlett enables Team 75 to gather valuable insights on competitions we aren't physically attending, giving us comprehensive data on every robot in play—potentially worldwide—if all goes to plan.
